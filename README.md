📉 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (City-wise Dissatisfaction)

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn caused by dissatisfaction across various cities.
The main objective is to identify which cities have the highest churn percentage due to dissatisfaction and visualize it using a pie chart.


🧩 Dataset Information

* Source: IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
* Key Features Used:

  * `customerID` – Unique customer identifier
  * `City` – Customer’s city or region
  * `Churn Category` – Reason for churn (e.g., Dissatisfaction, Competitor, etc.)
